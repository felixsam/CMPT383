;; list based implentation for environment

;; an empty environment is a list with two empty lists nested where:
;; first list holds v's 
;; second list holds val's


;; (extend-env v val env) will take v and add it to the front of the first list that contains v's
;; it will also take val and adds it to the front of the second list that contains val's


;; (apply-env env v) checks if the first element in the list containing v's is the v we are searching for
;; if it is get the corresponding val that matches with v
;; if it isn't check the rest of the v-list for the v we are searching
;; if the list of v's are searched, or the list is empty, return an error
